# YNAB converter for Dutch Banks 🏦.
Repo for a tool that converts bank exports from Rabo, ING and SNS to [YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://www.youneedabudget.com/).

You can use it HERE. Code runs in your browser, that means your data is never uploaded or shared.

Written as a side project because I wanted to get more familiar with typescript. Happy to support other banks, please open an issue and list it's CSV format.

[Sign-up for YNAB using my referral here.](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=JumKd2BcHjK0c9wN&utm_source=customer_referral)

Happy budgetting 💰.

## Want to host it yourself?
